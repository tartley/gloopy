windowing, and PyOpenGL for bindings & utils.

Very early development.

  * Pyglet 1.1.4
  * PyOpenGL 3.0.1

Thanks

PyWeek participants 'Scav' and 'Threads' for showing me how it should be done,
and PyWeek message board users donal.h, Cosmologicon, RB[0], PyTM30, Tee and
saluk for cajoling me into accepting the merit of allowing people to bring
pre-existing codebases into contests.
